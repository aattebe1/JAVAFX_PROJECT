This program was written in JavaFx using Eclipse Oxygen.2 (4.7.2).

No external dependencies are required. Build with eclipse or run the jar archive included in the project.



Project Notes:

	• All of the main pages are working correctly
	• The specific welcome message and the course information were not specified in the assignment, so some guesses were made as to what content was needed
	• The game is in a partially working state. It loads, and the animation seems good, but I have been unable to get the scoring or resetting to work correctly
